Using .NET Core, I developed a second-hand vehicle sales system that works on web and mobile platforms. This system is designed to manage and store detailed information about customers, vehicle models, sales listings, and vehicle owners.

Key Features:
  User Management: Vehicle owners can register on the system using their name, surname, email address, and password. Once registered, they can log in to manage their vehicle listings.
  
  Vehicle Listing Management: Vehicle owners can create new listings, view, edit, delete, and deactivate their existing listings. Listings include detailed information such as vehicle type, production year, brand, model, fuel type, engine, transmission, mileage, sale price, and vehicle images. Additional features like fog lights, foldable mirrors, parking sensors, central locking, and a sunroof can also be added.
  
  Listing Approval Process: When a vehicle owner adds a new listing or updates an existing one, the listing must be approved by the system administrators before being published. After approval, the listings become visible to users.
  
  Vehicle Search and Comparison: Buyers can browse featured listings, perform detailed searches, and find vehicles that match their criteria. They can also compare multiple vehicles side by side to make informed decisions.
  
  Customer Interaction: Customers can contact vehicle owners for listings they are interested in, leave comments, and share their opinions on listings.
  
  Admin Control: System administrators can add and update new vehicle types, brands, models, and features through the management panel.


Technology Stack:
  Backend: Developed with .NET Core using EF Core for data access.

  Database: MySQL was used for data management and storage.
